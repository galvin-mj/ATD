ATD: Anomalous Topic Discovery in High Dimensional Discrete Data

For details of the algorithm, please check the paper, Hossein Soleimani and David J. Miller, "ATD: Anomalous Topic Discovery in High Dimensional Discrete Data", arXiv:1512.06452.

1) Compile the programs (ATD, lda, M4, and PTM) in Linux-based system.
	Type 'make' in a shell in each folder ATDCode, lda, M4, and PTM.

2) Consult README.txt in the folders Synthetic, Reuters, and Newsgroup to reproduce the experiments.
